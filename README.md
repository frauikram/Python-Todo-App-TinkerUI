# Python-Todo-App-TinkerUI

In this Python code:

1. We create a `TodoApp` class inheriting from tk.Tk, which represents the main application window.
2. Inside the `TodoApp` class, we initialize the GUI elements such as a `Listbox` to display the to-do items, an Entry widget for users to input new to-do items, and a `Button` to add new items.
3. The `add_todo` method is called when the user clicks the "Add" button. It retrieves the text from the Entry widget, adds it to the list of to-do items, clears the `Entry`, and updates the displayed list.
4. The `update_todo_list` method refreshes the Listbox with the current list of to-do items.

- When the TodoApp instance is created, it calls the load_todo_items method to load the todo items from the todo_items.json file.
- Whenever a new todo item is added, edited, or deleted, the save_todo_items method is called to save the updated todo items to the file.
- The todo items are stored in a JSON format in the file, making it easy to load and save them using the json module.

- To run this code, make sure you have Tkinter installed (it's included in Python's standard library), then execute the script. You should see a window with a text entry field, a button, and a listbox where you can add and view to-do items. The app state will be retained even after closing and reopening the application, as the todo items will be loaded from and saved to the file.
